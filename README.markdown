# Getting started

After cloning the repo, run `rake` to initialise [NeoBundle](https://github.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim) and plugins (must have a network connection). (This will give an error initially about missing colour scheme until the plugin update completes.)

Then link:

* `repo` to `~/.vim`
* `repo/vimrc` to `~/.vimrc`
* `repo/gvimrc` to `~/.gvimrc`

To update plugins run `rake update_plugins`.

# Thanks to...
